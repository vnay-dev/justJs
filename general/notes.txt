the shortest js program is an empty js file
linked to an html file

how?

    run the js file
    go the console --> sources --> debugger on the first line
    a global execution context is created
    and sets up the memory space

    now go to the console
    type in window and press enter
    it returns a window object

    window object is created by the js engine 
    along with the global execution context
    we can access these object attributes anywhere in our code

    if we type in a this keyword and press enter
    it also returns the same window object
    since this keyword is pointing to the window object
    it is returning the window object

    hence when a js code runs 
    a global execution context + window object + this keyword 
    gets generated

    all browsers that runs js code have a js engine
    chrome has v8 engine 
    js engines have the responsibility to create a global object
    for browsers its called window

    at the global level
    this === window (type this into the console, it will return true)

    global space : any variable/object that is not included inside a function

    if we run this code :-

        var x = 10
        function a(){
            var b = 9
        }

    go to console and type in window 
    inside the window object we can find x and function a 
    but wont find b as it is not in global space 

        console.log(window.x)   // returns 10
        console.log(x)          // engine assumes that we are referring to the global space and prints 10
        console.log(b)          // will show error : b is not defined (as it is not there in the global scope)

        console.log(this.x)     // returns 10 (window is same as this on global scope)
