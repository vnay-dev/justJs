undefined

this is the placeholder keyword that is given to variables
during the memory component phase
even before code actually runs 

    console.log(a)  // undefined
    var a = 10  
    console.log(a)  // 10

    var a
    console.log(a)  // undefined

js is a loosely typed language
first we can initialise a with a string
second we can initialise a with a number

its not a good practice to do the following

    var a = undefined

because it is already a reserved placeholder keyword 
that says nothing was assigned to it
