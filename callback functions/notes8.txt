callback function

in first class functions
we can pass functions as arguements
these are called callback functions

in setTimeout we provide first arguement as a callback function

    setTimeout(cb, 500)
    
    function x(y){

    }
    
    x(function y(){
        // some code 
    })

    the function in the time out will get scheduled for 500ms
    and js doesnt wait it continues to execute the next line asynchronously
    after 500ms cb gets invoked
