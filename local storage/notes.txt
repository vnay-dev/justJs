web storage apis is used to store data locally on the browser
this data is in the form of key value pairs of strings (large object)

two ways to store :-
    session storage 
    local storage 

session storage 

    data is persistent only for that particular session 
    suppose we visit a website, at the point of entry, a session is started 
    when the tab in which that website is opened is closed 
    all the session data is lost
    better than cookies 
    unilke cookies, session data is not sent to the server through network calls 
    session storage has very large capacity to hold data
    eg: cookies can store about 4000 bytes of data while
        session storage can hold 5mb of data (minimum)

local storage 

    same as session storage
    but the advantage is that local storage does not clear itself 
    even if we close the tab or turn off our system, 
    the local storage data will be still present in the browser
    as long as we want 
    local storage has the largest capaity to store data 
    when compared with cookies and session storage
    the memory capacity depends on the type of system, browser that the user uses 
    easier to fetch local storage data instead of making network calls 
    useful for optimising the performance of the web app 

all storage apis follow the same origin policy
because of the security concerns 

origin contains three components :-
    1. protocol - http/https
    2. host - domain 
    3. port 
we set data for that particular origin 
changes in any of these components will restrict the access 

local storage is present in the window object
