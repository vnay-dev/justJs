EVENT DELEGATION

It is a technique used in handling events in a webpage in a better way
Event delegation is based on event bubbling

we often have to add a lot of event handlers for a lot of html components
such as click, onchange etc
as these event handlers increases
it critically affects the performance of the webpage
as we have a lot of event handlers crowded in the script file
Hence, we have event delegation to solve this problem.

Eg: in an e-commerce website, say we have a lot of categories

    laptops, shoes, cameras

    say, all these divs have ids like #laptop, #shoes, #cameras

    when we click on these divs it must redirect us to a new page
    say domain-name/laptop etc which shows the information of the corresponding product.

    normally we do,

        document.querySelector('#laptop')
            .addEventListener('click',()=>{
                window.location('domain-name/laptop)
            })
    
    we add the same code to all the rest of the categories that exist in that page
    or we add an onclick attribute to each html div elements

    all the above methods affects performance

    So, event delegation says that

        instead of attaching event handlers for each child divs
        attach a single event handler for its parent div that contains all the child divs

    Eg: say if all these laptops, shoes, cameras are enclosed in a parent div 
        with an id #categories
        attach an event handler on that parent div
        so that it keeps listening to any event changes that happens on the child

        say, if an onclick event happens on the child div
        the event bubbles out to the parent
        and the event listener attached to the parent gets invoked

PROS OF EVENT DELEGATION

1. Memory

    adding a single event handler to the parent div
    instead of attaching event handlers to many child divs
    can save a lot of Memory

2. Writing less code

3. DOM manipulation

    if infinite scrolling is implemented on the webpage
    then dynamically the child divs gets added on scrolling
    so attaching event listener on every child divs is not practical
    So we attach a single event handler onto the parent instead

CONS OF EVENT DELEGATION

1. All the events are not bubbled up

    some events like blur, focus, resize, scroll 
    wont bubble up the hierarchy

2. We cant use stop event propogation

    we cant use stop event propogation inside child divs
    because it prevents event bubbling from executing
    event delegation depends on event bubbling
