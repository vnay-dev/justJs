console.log("Start")
document.getElementById("btn")
    .addEventListener("click",function cb(){
        console.log("hello")
    })
console.log("end")

gec is created and pushed onto the call stack 
start is printed 
dom api is called 
registers a cb on event "click" 
end is printed 
gec is popped out 
event listener always remains as such unless we close the browser or we explicitly removes it 
when user clicks on the button 
cb pushed onto the callback queue and waits 

event loop continously monitors the callback queue and call stack 
it pushes the cb into the stack 
and it hello gets printed 
callback queue gets empty 

- why cant the event loop directy push the cb from the memory to the call stack without using callback queue

    suppose the user clicks the button like a couple of times 
    then those number of click events as cbs will be pushed onto the callback queue
    event loops executes them one by one
