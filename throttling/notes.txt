debouncing and throttling are methods to optimise performance of web apps
it is carried out by limiting the rate of function calls
if a particular function is getting called large number of times unnecessarily
this function can be a simple api fetch

Eg: suppose we have a search bar in an e-commerce website

    assume we have a getResults() that would make an api call 
    to fetch the search results data dynamically
    as and when we type

    we normally attach this function to the addEventListener with a keypress addEventListener
    this is not a good practice because 
    the function gets called every time a user types in the search bar
    which would result in large number of function calls 
    which will affect the performance of the web app

    debouncing :- call the function only when there is a pause
                  call the function when the difference in time between two keystrokes is 
                  more than say 300ms (which denotes a pause while typing by the user)

    throttling :- call the function after a certain amount of time (say 300ms)
                  say the function is called during the first keystroke
                  the next function call happens after waiting for 300ms
                  it ignores all the keystrokes in between

                  if the difference between the first and last function call is 300ms
                  then make the function call

Eg: to track the number of times the user is resizing the browser window

    attaching an event listener with resize event 
    makes large number of unnecessary api calls
    which is ineffecient

    the user may resize in either a slow or fast pace 

    debouncing :- call the function if the time between 
                  two successive resizing is say 300ms
                  if the pace of resizing is slow, make the function call

    throttling :- make the function call when the user resizes for the first time
                  wait for 300ms and then make the next function call

Eg: if there is a button and on clicking it will cause a function call
    what if the user keeps clicking it at fast rate
    the event listener gets called large number of times unnecessarily
    (like a shooter game)

    debouncing :- call the function if the time between 
                  two successive button clicks is say 300ms
                  if the user makes a pause in between two button clicks

    throttling :- make the function call when the user clicks for the first time
                  wait for 300ms and then make the next function call
                  (eg: machine gun can fire only after say 1s, so throttling is used)

                  let the user click the button at whatever rate
                  but if depending on the type of gun
                  the waiting time varies and so does the api call

Eg: tracking how many times the user has scrolled

**choosing between debouncing and throttling will totally depend on the use case
