**EVERYTHING IN JS HAPPENS INSIDE AN EXECUTION CONTEXT**

execution context is like a container inside which all the js code runs 

structure of execution context 

    it has two components : memory and code component

    memory component :- all the variables and functions are stores as key value pairs
                        a : 10
                        fn : {...}
                        a.k.a variable environment 

    code component :-   this is where code gets executed line by line
                        a.k.a thread of execution

**JAVASCRIPT IS A SYNCHRONOUS SINGLE THREADED LANGUAGE**

single threaded :- can only execute one line at a time
synchronous single threaded :- can only execute one line at a time in a single order
