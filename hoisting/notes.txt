hoisting is the method by which
we can access variables and functions
even before initialising it
its location in the code doesnt matter

in six.js

    in the console, go to sources and put a debugger at 
        var x = 7
    now look at the scope below
    find x
    we can see that the x is undefined

    basically its all about execution context
    first phase of memory component is all about allocating memory 
    so x : undefined
    and show : code of function

in five.js

    place a debugger in the first line

    show() is function invokation, hence prints hello world
    console.log(x) prints undefined, as it is not initialised yet
    console.log(show) prints the code of the function, as it is not invoked it shows
                      the value assigned to it during the memory component phase

in three.js

    x is not present anywhere in the function
    hence it throws an error saying
    x is not defined

we can see the working of call stack towards the left side of scope
by placing debugger at the function invokation points 
we can see how the execution context gets pushed and popped
