Go to flipkart's search bar 
Start typing something
If we check the networks bar in the console, we will see that
the api call 'autosuggest' is not called on every key stroke but
is called when we pause while typing (called 2 times approx)
Hence, api call is made for every pause, which is the efficient.
This is called debouncing.

Can be implemented for scroll events as well
