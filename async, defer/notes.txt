async and defer are boolean attributes that is added along with script tags
to load external script files efficiently to our web page

can do this in 3 ways:
1. normal script tags
2. async attribute in a script tag
3. defer attribute in a script tag

when we load a web page, 2 key things happen:
1. html parsing
2. loading of scripts

loading script files contain 2 key things:
1. fetching scripts from the network
2. executing the script files line by line

Normal script tags :

        browser starts parsing the html line by line and suddenly
        it encounters a script tag
        browser now stops the html parsing
        fetches the script file from the network and
        executes it then and there
        once the script execution is complete
        html parsing resumes

        Hence, javascript files blocks the rendering of html page
        this is not an efficient method

Async attribute : 

        along with the html parsing
        browser fetches the script files that has async tag on it from the network, asynchronously
        once the script files are fetched
        html parsing stops and script files are executed then and there
        once, the script files execution is finished
        html parsing resumes

        Hence, javascript files blocks the rendering of html page during execution
        this is not an efficient method

        this does not gaurentee the order of execution of scripts, especially
        when we add async attribute to scripts that are inter-dependent on each other
        this may break our code

        if we want to add a script file which is independent from our normal code
        eg: google analytics script file etc 
        then using async attribute is a good choice

Defer attribute : 

        along with the html parsing
        browser fetches the script files that has defer tag on it from the network, parallely
        but the html parsing never stops
        once the html parsing gets completed
        script files gets executed

        this does gaurentee the order of execution of scripts
        hence for inter-dependent scripts, we can use defer
